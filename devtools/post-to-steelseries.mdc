**Title:** Legacy Zboard Driver Revival — Request for Technical Docs

**Body:**

Hello SteelSeries team,

We're a group of developers, gamers, and hardware preservationists working on an open-source Windows 11 driver for the iconic **Zboard Gaming Keyboard** (model: PW1USE1-B3ZBD01).

🔧 Why?
This keyboard was ahead of its time — modular, programmable, and beloved by gamers. Sadly, it's no longer supported on modern systems. We're aiming to fix that.

🎯 What We've Done:
- Built a working INF+CAT HID driver
- Added modular keyset support
- Released it on GitHub under MIT license
- Reached out to the community for USB descriptor logs

💬 How You Can Help:
If SteelSeries still holds:
- USB descriptor docs
- Old layouts
- Firmware interface specs
…even partial, it would greatly accelerate this restoration.

🤝 No obligations, no branding misuse — just love for a great device.

Thanks for considering it!
