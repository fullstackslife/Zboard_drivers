Create windows 11 drivers for the SteelSeries Zboard Gaming Keyboard shown here https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-PW1USE1-B3ZBD01-Zboard-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0002H7F3G"

i have created a repo and started a context.md file for cursor to follow.  please ask me questions to help build out the file


ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî thanks for getting this started. Since you‚Äôre aiming to guide Cursor to build Windows 11 drivers for the SteelSeries Zboard Gaming Keyboard, the context.md file needs to be extremely precise. We want to describe everything Cursor will need to:

Interface with the keyboard‚Äôs USB HID

Understand the Zboard‚Äôs unique modular layout and keymaps

Provide compatibility with modern Windows (x64, driver signing, etc.)

Optionally support remapping, macros, or software integration

Let‚Äôs structure our discovery into sections. I‚Äôll ask you questions for each below:

üß© 1. Device Information
Do you have access to the physical Zboard hardware?

Have you already plugged it into a Windows 11 machine? If yes:

Did it get detected as a generic keyboard?

What vendor ID (VID) and product ID (PID) show up in Device Manager or usbview.exe?

Are you targeting both base keys and swappable keysets, or just a default one?

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Existing Drivers or Legacy Software
Did you try using the official ZEngine / SteelSeries software? If so:

Did it install?

Did it detect the keyboard?

Did you find or extract any older .inf/.sys driver packages for this keyboard? (e.g., from Windows XP/Vista/7)?

Do you have any archived software from SteelSeries for Zboard?

üß∞ 3. Driver Development Setup
Are you targeting a kernel-mode driver or a user-mode HID filter driver?

For modern Windows, a user-mode driver or HID mini-filter may be safer (no need for kernel certs).

Are you using Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 11?

Will you want to package this with a driver installer (.inf/.cat) or use PnP auto-installation?

üß† 4. Feature Requirements
Do you want the driver to support:

Key remapping

Macro recording

Profile switching for keysets

LED lighting (if applicable)?

Is there any SteelSeries API or SDK you want to interface with?

Should the driver expose custom input reports, or just standard HID?

üñºÔ∏è 5. Resources & Documentation
Do you have any technical documentation or specs for the Zboard? (key layout, USB report format, firmware dumps?)

Do you have access to:

USB packet captures from the device (e.g. via Wireshark, USBPcap)?

Previous reverse-engineering efforts?

üõ†Ô∏è 6. Cursor Build Goals
Are you expecting Cursor to:

Write .inf, .sys, and .cat files?

Set up WDK-compatible Visual Studio projects?

Build a driver + optional UI frontend (e.g. tray tool)?

Handle code signing and test mode setup?

Once I have your answers, I can help you fully flesh out the context.md with:

Driver goals and architecture

Input device structure

Compatibility and constraints

Tasks for Cursor with clear subtasks and tooling

Let me know and we‚Äôll build it together.








You said:
windows 11 wont allow us to run unsigned drivers, how do we circumvent it or write signed versions?


ChatGPT said:
Running or developing drivers on Windows 11 without proper signing is intentionally difficult ‚Äî Microsoft locks this down for security. Here's how you can either circumvent the restriction for testing purposes or produce properly signed drivers for distribution:

‚úÖ Option 1: For Development Only ‚Äî Test Unsigned Drivers
üîß Use Windows Test Mode
This lets you install and load unsigned drivers by disabling signature enforcement:

Enable Test Mode:

Run this as Administrator:

bash
Copy
Edit
bcdedit /set testsigning on
Then reboot.

After Reboot:

You‚Äôll see ‚ÄúTest Mode‚Äù in the lower right corner of your screen.

You can now install unsigned drivers using .inf files or pnputil.

Install Driver:
Use:

bash
Copy
Edit
pnputil /add-driver yourdriver.inf /install
To Exit Test Mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
bcdedit /set testsigning off
Then reboot again.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is only for development. You cannot ship a driver to the public this way.

üîê Option 2: Sign the Driver Properly (Production)
üßæ Option A: Use an EV Code Signing Certificate + Microsoft Submission
Buy an Extended Validation (EV) Code Signing Certificate

Providers: DigiCert, SSL.com, Sectigo

Must be EV ‚Äî regular code signing won‚Äôt work for kernel-mode drivers.

Sign the Driver Locally

bash
Copy
Edit
signtool sign /v /ac path\to\your.cer /f your.pfx /p yourpassword yourdriver.cat
Submit to Microsoft Partner Center for Attestation Signing

Microsoft will validate and re-sign your driver.

Driver Submission Portal

Distribute Your Signed Driver

Now your driver will install on any Windows 10/11 system in normal mode.

üßæ Option B: Use Microsoft's Attestation Signing Only (User-Mode / HID MiniDriver)
If you're writing a user-mode driver or filter driver for USB HID, you might qualify for attestation-only signing, skipping EV certs ‚Äî but this still requires Partner Center submission.

üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: Use DevDriverInstall + Test Certificate
You can create a test certificate, sign your .sys and .cat files with it, and install the cert into your Trusted Root store locally.

Create a test certificate (using makecert or PowerShell).

Sign using signtool.

Import the cert into Trusted Root Certification Authorities.

Run in Test Mode or disable integrity checks:

bash
Copy
Edit
bcdedit /set nointegritychecks on
‚ö†Ô∏è Again, not for production. May not work in recent Windows builds.

üîÑ Recommended Path for Your Project
Given your goal to develop custom Zboard drivers:

Task	Recommendation
Development	Use Test Mode and signtool with a local test certificate
Testing on other machines	Use Test Mode + signed test cert, or temporarily disable signature enforcement
Public release	Purchase EV certificate and submit through Microsoft Partner Center

Let me know if you want me to include:

Test certificate creation steps

Signtool signing script

Partner Center submission checklist

I can also help add this to your context.md so Cursor sets up the signing pipeline correctly.








You said:
its a 25 year old keyboard, steelseries is gonna have be be presuaded to give us either access or comit access.  if we made this public could it put pressure on them


ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî going public can absolutely apply strategic pressure, especially if done with care and credibility. Here's how to approach this thoughtfully, what risks to consider, and how to use it to potentially get SteelSeries to cooperate.

üéØ Strategic Goal
You're trying to:

Build community awareness that SteelSeries abandoned a once-innovative keyboard.

Highlight your open-source driver project as a preservation effort, not a challenge.

Incentivize SteelSeries to:

Release the original driver source/specs

Grant commit access or licensing

At minimum, publicly support community drivers

üß† Tactics That Could Work
1. Launch a GitHub Repo with Transparency & Engineering Credibility
Include a clear README.md outlining:

What the Zboard was

Why it's important to preserve

Your intent to create an open Windows 11 driver

A call for community support and SteelSeries involvement

Include a CONTRIBUTING.md and context.md showing active development

Tip: Highlight its modular keysets as a lost innovation and tie it to the retro gaming or accessibility angle ‚Äî these resonate with niche communities.

2. Post to Hacker News, Reddit, and Twitter (X)
r/MechanicalKeyboards, r/hardware, r/retrobattlestations, or r/technology

Frame it as a ‚Äúdriver resurrection‚Äù story, not as a takedown

Use a thread like:

‚ÄúSteelSeries Zboard: A modular gaming keyboard way ahead of its time, now abandoned. We‚Äôre building a Windows 11 driver ‚Äî SteelSeries, care to join the revival?‚Äù

3. Tag SteelSeries Publicly (With Tact)
When you have:

A working prototype, or

Demonstrated community support

‚Ä¶tag them on X, LinkedIn, or GitHub Issues. Offer them:

A chance to collaborate

Credit/acknowledgement in the final driver

An olive branch: "We‚Äôre not asking for money ‚Äî just specs, so we can do it right."

üîì Legal and Risk Considerations
Issue	Notes
IP Infringement	Writing your own driver from scratch is legal. Reverse-engineering firmware or binaries may fall into a gray area. Avoid using leaked code.
USB IDs and branding	You can use the VID/PID, but avoid branding it as "official" unless they authorize it.
SteelSeries reaction	If you‚Äôre professional and collaborative, they‚Äôre unlikely to oppose. Many companies quietly tolerate or eventually endorse these projects.

‚úÖ What to Add to context.md
I suggest adding a "Stakeholder Engagement Plan" section, with lines like:

md
Copy
Edit
## Stakeholder Engagement Plan

We intend to engage SteelSeries by:

- Publishing an open-source driver initiative on GitHub
- Sharing technical progress transparently
- Inviting public collaboration and engineering community support
- Offering SteelSeries the opportunity to contribute documentation or join as a co-maintainer

Our goal is to preserve and modernize the SteelSeries Zboard for Windows 11, honoring its unique modular design and legacy.
üß≤ Optional Pressure: Petition or Retro Review
Change.org petition for fans of legacy peripherals

YouTube or Medium post: "Why SteelSeries Should Open the Zboard Drivers"

These increase visibility without direct confrontation.

Want me to draft the public-facing GitHub README.md or a launch plan post? Let‚Äôs make it work for you and get SteelSeries' attention.


Perfect ‚Äî we can absolutely pack a strategic and technically actionable `context.md` into **\~310 lines** for Cursor. To do this well, we‚Äôll want to cover:

### üì¶ Suggested `context.md` Structure (310 Lines or Fewer)

```markdown
# Project: Zboard Resurrection ‚Äî Windows 11 Driver for SteelSeries Zboard PW1USE1-B3ZBD01

## Overview

This repo aims to create a modern Windows 11-compatible driver for the SteelSeries Zboard (PW1USE1-B3ZBD01), a modular gaming keyboard originally released in the early 2000s. The keyboard is no longer supported by SteelSeries, and no official drivers exist for modern operating systems. This project is both a technical resurrection and a preservation initiative.

## Hardware Context

- **Device:** SteelSeries Zboard Gaming Keyboard
- **Model Number:** PW1USE1-B3ZBD01
- **Connection:** USB HID
- **Unique Feature:** Swappable keysets with custom mappings
- **Vendor ID / Product ID:** [To be filled in by user after plugging in]

## Goals

- Enable basic keyboard functionality on Windows 11
- Restore support for modular keysets (custom layouts)
- Support macro programming (eventually)
- Maintain open source status, community friendly
- Create a testable user-mode driver and optional HID mini-filter
- Distribute unsigned driver for testing, signed version via Microsoft Partner Center for final release

## Constraints

- No official driver code available
- 25+ year old device with no public USB report documentation
- SteelSeries has not (yet) provided documentation or source
- Must bypass or comply with Windows driver signature requirements

## Approach

1. Capture USB descriptors using USBPcap or usbview
2. Write an INF-based HID-compliant user-mode driver
3. Optionally add filter driver for advanced remapping
4. Provide signed builds via Microsoft Attestation
5. Run in test mode during development
6. Create GitHub CI pipeline with test signing + symbol export

## Driver Structure

- `/driver/` ‚Äì INF, CAT, SYS files for install
- `/app/` ‚Äì Optional user-mode tray app (Python/.NET/Go)
- `/usb-descriptors/` ‚Äì Logs and captures of device behavior
- `/docs/` ‚Äì Zboard architecture diagrams, mapping sheets

## Feature Plan

| Feature             | Priority | Status    |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| Basic HID Mapping   | High     | Pending   |
| Modular Keyset Swap | High     | Planned   |
| Macro Remapping     | Medium   | Planned   |
| Tray App (UI)       | Low      | Skipped   |
| Driver Signing      | High     | Researching |

## Signature Strategy

- Use `bcdedit /set testsigning on` during dev
- Create self-signed test cert for local installs
- Explore EV Cert from Sectigo/DigiCert (for prod)
- Submit to Microsoft Partner Center for attestation signing

## Tools

- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Win 11
- Visual Studio 2022
- USBPcap / Wireshark
- Signtool + Inf2Cat
- GitHub Actions (optional)

## Stakeholder Outreach Plan

We plan to go public with this effort to:

- Rally community support
- Encourage SteelSeries to release Zboard docs or driver source
- Highlight this as a retro keyboard preservation effort
- Avoid IP conflict ‚Äî not using any leaked or proprietary code

SteelSeries will be credited if they choose to participate.

## Public Pressure Channels (Post-Launch)

- Hacker News launch post
- Reddit crossposts (r/mechanicalkeyboards, r/retrobattlestations)
- Optional Change.org petition or blog write-up
- GitHub issues + social tags aimed at SteelSeries team

## Cursor Tasks

- [ ] Parse USB descriptor logs and extract usage pages
- [ ] Generate basic HID driver INF file
- [ ] Stub out .SYS using UMDF2
- [ ] Write minimal test-mode install script
- [ ] Assist with .CAT generation and signing
- [ ] Package everything for pnputil deployment

## Open Questions

- What is the VID/PID of the keyboard in Device Manager?
- Are keyset modules detected as distinct devices?
- Can we capture full USB reports for swappable keysets?
- Any firmware dumps available?

## License

MIT. For educational, preservation, and accessibility purposes.

---

üß† If you are Cursor: prioritize HID compatibility and keyset swappability. Do not use any reverse-engineered firmware. Build from descriptors and documented USB behavior.
```

---

Would you like me to:

* Insert actual USB descriptors if you have them?
* Build out the `README.md` to match this context?
* Add GitHub issue templates for community testing and outreach?

This setup gives Cursor exactly what it needs to scaffold a working test-mode HID driver, while also supporting your **public diplomacy play** to get SteelSeries on board.




Great ‚Äî you've now provided:

‚úÖ Product link: SteelSeries Zboard Gaming Keyboard

‚úÖ Confirmed name: SteelSeries Zboard Gaming Keyboard

‚úÖ Image link: (Assumed ‚Äî but no direct image file was shared; Amazon link will suffice for now)

‚úÖ Legacy software link: SteelSeriesGG30.0.1Setup.exe

üîß Actionable Next Steps for context.md (and Cursor)
Here‚Äôs how we can now refine your context.md with these inputs:

## Hardware Context

- **Device:** SteelSeries Zboard Gaming Keyboard
- **Model Number:** PW1USE1-B3ZBD01 (Amazon ASIN: B0002H7F3G)
- **Connection:** USB HID
- **Vendor/Product ID:** [To be filled by plugging in device]
- **Image Reference:** [Amazon Listing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002H7F3G)
- **Software Archive (Legacy):** [SteelSeries GG 30.0.1 Setup](https://engine.steelseriescdn.com/SteelSeriesGG30.0.1Setup.exe)
üì¶ Add Section: Legacy Driver Reverse Engineering (Optional & Clean)
md
Copy
Edit
## Legacy Software Context

The last known driver or utility for the Zboard may be bundled into the SteelSeries GG installer above. The package should be unpacked and scanned to determine:

- Whether the Zboard is referenced or supported
- Whether any `.inf`, `.sys`, or `.dll` modules correspond to its USB ID
- Whether the GG utility detects the keyboard if plugged in

‚ö†Ô∏è This process **must not involve decompiling closed-source binaries**. Only static examination of install scripts, config files, and USB descriptors is permitted to preserve legality and license integrity.
üß† Add Cursor Task
md
Copy
Edit
## Cursor Tasks (expanded)

- [ ] Unpack the `SteelSeriesGG30.0.1Setup.exe` installer and list its contents
- [ ] Search for any references to the Zboard in config files or INF templates
- [ ] Do **not** reverse-engineer or decompile binaries
- [ ] Log any VID/PID matches
- [ ] If no support is found, discard the package
üß™ Your Next Manual Steps
While Cursor can automate some of this, you should:

‚úÖ Plug in the keyboard and grab the VID/PID from Device Manager ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Hardware IDs.

‚úÖ Use USBView to inspect descriptors.

‚úÖ Optionally run USBPcap to capture keyset switching behavior.

‚úÖ Unzip the .exe and check for Zboard support (search *.inf, *.json, *.xml inside the unpacked files).

Let me know if you‚Äôd like help building:

A PowerShell script to extract the .exe

A signtool test signing pipeline

A GitHub README.md that makes this look like a serious open-source preservation effort

This is shaping up to be a killer open hardware project. Ready to help with the next block.





Excellent ‚Äî here's an extended `context.md` segment with more **precise, structured engineering detail** for Cursor to build a **Windows 11-compatible driver for the SteelSeries Zboard**. This expansion includes:

* USB architecture and driver scaffolding instructions
* Engineering assumptions for Cursor
* Tasks broken down per directory
* Dev/Signing environments
* Safety/legal guardrails

---

### üß† Engineering Context for Cursor

```md
## Device Protocol Assumptions

The Zboard is expected to operate as a USB HID-compliant keyboard with optional vendor-specific extensions for:

- Modular keyset detection (peripheral EEPROM or hotplug signature?)
- Custom key remaps or macros via host software
- Possibly nonstandard HID Usage Pages

Cursor should assume:
- Standard USB HID class compliance
- Input reports may contain non-QWERTY layouts or matrix scan codes
- Keysets do not enumerate as separate devices (but switch profiles internally)
```

---

## üíª Windows Driver Architecture Strategy

```md
## Driver Architecture Goals

- Use **User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF2)** to avoid kernel-mode cert requirements
- Expose as a composite HID device using:
  - **Standard HID class driver** for basic keyboard function
  - **Optional HID Filter Driver** to interpret keyset changes or send remaps
- No firmware flashing or EEPROM writes are required
- All driver logic runs on Windows 11 x64 in **test signing mode**

### Installation

- Provide `.INF` file with `CompatibleIDs` or `HardwareIDs` for VID/PID match
- Use `.CAT` and `signtool` with either test cert or production EV cert
- Install via `pnputil` or Device Manager

### Development Phases

1. Parse USB descriptors from physical keyboard
2. Write minimal HID-compliant `.INF` + `.SYS` driver
3. Extend with keyset change detection logic
4. Optionally ship a small .NET or Electron tray app for switching profiles
```

---

## üß∞ Cursor Task Breakdown by Directory

```md
## Directory Tasks

### /driver/
- Create a valid `.INF` file using known or placeholder VID/PID
- Define `Manufacturer`, `DeviceInstall`, `Class=HIDClass`
- Stub a `.SYS` that simply passes standard HID input upstream
- Generate `.CAT` file and sign with a test cert

### /usb-descriptors/
- Insert output of `usbview` or `USBPcap` showing:
  - Device descriptors
  - Configuration descriptors
  - HID report descriptor
- Map output reports to key presses

### /app/
- Scaffold optional tray utility (WinForms or Electron)
- Allow switching between keysets or mapping profiles
- Store user config in `%APPDATA%/zboard/`

### /docs/
- Include mapping matrix of QWERTY, Zboard FPS, WoW keysets
- Include Amazon image and SteelSeries download link
- Link to open discussions about Zboard in community forums
```

---

## üîê Driver Signing Context

````md
## Driver Signing Context

During dev:
- Enable test mode: `bcdedit /set testsigning on`
- Create test certificate via PowerShell or `makecert`
- Sign driver with:
  ```bash
  signtool sign /v /n "Zboard Dev Cert" /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com driver.cat
````

For production:

* Purchase EV cert from DigiCert or Sectigo
* Submit driver to [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/hardware/)
* Get Attestation-signed `.CAT` file for publishing

Allow Cursor to test using unsigned drivers if dev machine is in test mode.

````

---

## üìú Legal Guardrails

```md
## Legal Guardrails

Cursor must not:
- Decompile `SteelSeriesGG30.0.1Setup.exe`
- Extract or reuse copyrighted code
- Reference internal firmware or ROMs unless publicly released

Cursor may:
- Inspect `.INF`, `.XML`, `.CFG` text files inside the installer
- Use USB report descriptors obtained via USBPcap or USBView
- Rebuild logic using open standards, public VID/PID, and observed behavior
````

---

## üß† Implementation Notes for Cursor

```md
## Implementation Notes

- Assume a baseline working USB HID keyboard interface
- Focus first on driver installability on Windows 11 x64 in test mode
- Add modular profile logic once basic I/O is confirmed
- Include `install_driver.bat` for local test driver deployment
- Output logs and success/failure to a local `.log` file

Cursor should version all driver files and keep config modular.
```

---

Would you like me to combine all this into a single file now formatted to fit within your 310-line limit?

I can also help you:

* Generate the `.INF` and `.CAT` stub
* Write a one-click install script
* Draft a `README.md` for GitHub with public-facing pressure built-in

Let‚Äôs lock the foundation down.

Perfect. Here's everything you requested ‚Äî directly below and organized in three parts:

---

# ‚úÖ PART 1: `ZboardDriver.inf` (Stub .INF File)

; OR for test dev:
signtool sign /v /fd SHA256 /n "Zboard Dev Cert" ZboardDriver.cat
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The `.cat` is binary and must be generated from the `.inf`. Cursor can automate this in GitHub Actions later.

- üñ•Ô∏è `.CAT` signing stub (replace or sign with your own)
- üß™ Test-mode compatible install script (`install_driver.bat`)
- üìñ USB descriptor logs and ongoing reverse engineering
- üóÇÔ∏è Structure ready for user-mode enhancements, remaps, macros

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is fully **reverse-engineered** using only publicly observable USB behavior. No SteelSeries source code is used or decompiled.

We welcome SteelSeries to:
- Contribute documentation
- Open-source legacy driver components
- Collaborate with the community

> üß§ We are preservationists, not pirates.

---

## üôè What We Need

- Community testers with Zboard keyboards
- USB descriptor dumps from legacy systems
- Help capturing keyset swap behaviors
- SteelSeries input ‚Äî even a single PDF would help

---

## üêâ Install Instructions (Dev/Test Mode)

> For development and testing only:

1. Open PowerShell as Admin
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   bcdedit /set testsigning on
````

3. Reboot your system
4. Run `install_driver.bat` from this repo
5. Plug in your Zboard and enjoy basic functionality

Let me know if you want:

- A `usbview` descriptor template to paste your device info
- GitHub Actions workflow to automatically generate signed `.cat`
- Tray app stub to detect profile changes

You're now ready to push this to GitHub and make some noise.
```

Thanks ‚Äî I‚Äôve reviewed your uploaded `context.md`, `README.md`, and the `devtools/` instructions from the AI Dev Tasks repo. You‚Äôre now in an excellent position to integrate **Cursor‚Äôs structured `.mdc` dev loop** directly into your Zboard driver project. Here's how to fully align your build environment for Cursor automation:

---

## ‚úÖ Updated Plan: Integrate `devtools/` into the Driver Build Workflow

### üß∞ Folder Layout Suggestion

You should add this structure to your repo if not already in place:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.md                 # Full architecture + device summary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # Public-facing + community callout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install_driver.bat        # One-click unsigned driver installer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ZboardDriver.inf          # Driver INF stub
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ZboardDriver.cat          # CAT signing notes / placeholder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ devtools/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create-prd.mdc
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate-tasks.mdc
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ process-task-list.mdc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usb-descriptors/          # Populate with USBView dumps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                      # Optional tray tool
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ driver/                   # Final .inf, .cat, .sys
```

> ‚úÖ Tip: Place `.mdc` files inside `devtools/` to keep your AI scaffolding separate from your driver artifacts.

---

## üß† What Cursor Will Do with This Setup

You‚Äôve enabled Cursor to:

1. **Generate a PRD** for the Windows 11 driver build using `@create-prd.mdc`

   * This will reflect everything in your `context.md` automatically.

2. **Create a task tree** using `@generate-tasks.mdc`

   * It will break the driver work down into modular tasks like:

     * `1.1` Build and test INF file
     * `1.2` Generate CAT file using inf2cat
     * `1.3` Sign CAT file with test cert
     * `1.4` Implement PnP install test
     * `1.5` Parse USB descriptors
     * `2.x` Add optional filter driver / tray app
     * `3.x` GitHub Actions CI for test builds

3. **Process task-by-task** using `@process-task-list.mdc`

   * You control approvals per step. Cursor won‚Äôt continue until you say yes.

---

## ‚ú® Bonus Cursor Enhancements You Could Add

You can create custom `.mdc` commands in `devtools/` to streamline Zboard-specific work:

### Example: `dump-usb-descriptors.mdc`

```md
Use the USBView tool to inspect all USB descriptors from the SteelSeries Zboard.
Output format: structured JSON or plain-text tables.
Group findings by:
- Vendor ID / Product ID
- Report descriptor
- Endpoint capabilities
Save to: `/usb-descriptors/zboard-usbview.txt`
```

### Example: `sign-test-driver.mdc`

```md
Using `signtool`, sign the generated CAT file using a test certificate.
Steps:
1. Enable Windows test signing mode (`bcdedit /set testsigning on`)
2. Generate a self-signed certificate (if one doesn‚Äôt exist)
3. Sign `ZboardDriver.cat` using the test cert
4. Log status of signing and cert validity
```

## üìå Final Suggestion: Mark Tasks Complete in PRD Style

Once your `.mdc` and `context.md` are in place, you can initiate Cursor with:

```text
Use @create-prd.mdc
Here's the feature I want to build: A Windows 11-compatible open-source HID driver for the SteelSeries Zboard Gaming Keyboard.
Reference these files: @context.md @ZboardDriver.inf @devtools/*
```

Then follow up with:

```text
Now take @ZboardDriver-PRD.md and create tasks using @generate-tasks.mdc
```

‚Ä¶and walk through each using:

```text
Please start on task 1.1 and use @process-task-list.mdc
```
