# Product Requirements Document: Zboard Complete Software Stack
**Making Jamie Dig That Keyboard Out of the Garage** ðŸŽ®

## Introduction/Overview

The SteelSeries Zboard was a revolutionary modular gaming keyboard ahead of its time, but it's currently gathering dust in garages worldwide due to lack of modern Windows 11 support. This project aims to create a **complete software stack** that not only restores full functionality but makes the Zboard BETTER than the original - with proper drivers, mapping software, and modern gaming features.

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive solution that makes Jamie (and other Zboard owners) excited to dust off their keyboards and start gaming again.

## Goals

1. **Driver Foundation**: Create Windows 11-compatible HID drivers that properly recognize the Zboard and its modular keysets
2. **Mapping Software**: Build modern mapping software that can detect, configure, and switch between keysets
3. **Modern Features**: Add contemporary gaming features (macros, profiles, cloud sync) that the original ZEngine lacked
4. **Multi-Interface**: Provide tray app, full GUI, web interface, and CLI tools for different user preferences
5. **Community Platform**: Enable sharing of custom layouts and configurations
6. **Jamie Satisfaction**: Successfully motivate Jamie to retrieve her Zboard from the garage

## User Stories

### Primary User: Jamie
- **As a Zboard owner**, I want my keyboard to work on Windows 11 so I can use it again
- **As a gamer**, I want to switch between keysets (FPS, WoW, QWERTY) seamlessly so I can optimize for different games
- **As a power user**, I want to create custom key mappings and macros so I can tailor the keyboard to my needs
- **As a collector**, I want to preserve this piece of gaming history so future generations can appreciate it

### Secondary Users: Community
- **As a retro gaming enthusiast**, I want to contribute custom layouts so others can benefit from my configurations
- **As a developer**, I want to extend the software with new features so the platform can evolve
- **As a new Zboard owner**, I want to discover and download community-created layouts so I can get started quickly

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Driver Layer
1. The system must detect the Zboard as a USB HID device on Windows 11
2. The system must recognize when different keysets are inserted/removed
3. The system must provide proper input handling for all keyset configurations
4. The system must support hot-plugging of keysets without requiring driver restart
5. The system must maintain compatibility with existing Windows keyboard functionality

### 2. Mapping Software Core

8. The system must include a web-based interface accessible from any device
9. The system must provide command-line tools for power users and automation
10. The system must detect and display all connected Zboard devices and their current keysets

### 3. Key Mapping & Configuration
11. The system must allow users to create custom key mappings for any keyset
12. The system must support macro recording and playback
13. The system must enable profile creation and switching for different games/applications
14. The system must provide visual feedback when keysets are changed
15. The system must save and load configuration files in standard formats (JSON, XML)

### 4. Modern Gaming Features
16. The system must support cloud synchronization of profiles and settings
17. The system must provide game detection and automatic profile switching
18. The system must include a macro editor with timing and conditional logic
19. The system must support RGB lighting control (if hardware supports it)
20. The system must provide performance monitoring and input latency optimization

### 5. Community Features
21. The system must allow users to share custom layouts and configurations
22. The system must provide a marketplace/library for community-created content
23. The system must include rating and review systems for shared content
24. The system must support versioning and updates for shared configurations
25. The system must provide search and filtering capabilities for finding specific layouts

### 6. Data Management
26. The system must store user configurations locally with cloud backup option
27. The system must support import/export of configurations in multiple formats
28. The system must provide configuration migration tools for different Zboard models
29. The system must include backup and restore functionality
30. The system must maintain user privacy and data security

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Firmware Modification**: The system will not modify or reverse-engineer SteelSeries firmware
- **Kernel-Mode Drivers**: The system will use user-mode drivers to avoid signature requirements
- **Commercial Software**: The system will remain open-source and free to use
- **Hardware Emulation**: The system will not attempt to emulate Zboard hardware on other keyboards
- **SteelSeries Integration**: The system will not integrate with current SteelSeries software (unless they provide official support)

## Design Considerations

### User Interface Philosophy
- **"No Spinning Rims"**: Focus on functionality over flashy visuals
- **Multi-Modal Access**: Provide multiple ways to interact (tray, GUI, web, CLI)
- **Retro-Modern Aesthetic**: Blend nostalgic Zboard styling with modern UI patterns
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the software is usable by people with different abilities

### Technical Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate driver, mapping, and UI components for maintainability
- **Cross-Platform Foundation**: Build on technologies that could support other operating systems
- **Extensible Framework**: Design for community contributions and plugin development
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for low latency and minimal resource usage

## Technical Considerations

### Development Stack
- **Driver**: Windows Driver Kit (WDK) with user-mode HID framework
- **Backend**: .NET Core or Node.js for cross-platform compatibility
- **Frontend**: Electron for desktop apps, React for web interface
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage, cloud sync for remote backup
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time device communication

### Integration Points
- **Windows HID API**: For device detection and input handling
- **Steam API**: For game detection and automatic profile switching
- **Cloud Storage**: For profile synchronization and community sharing
- **GitHub**: For community contributions and version control

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
- **Jamie Engagement**: Jamie successfully retrieves her Zboard from the garage and begins using it
- **Functionality**: All original Zboard features work on Windows 11
- **Performance**: Input latency is equal to or better than original ZEngine software

### Secondary Success Criteria
- **Community Growth**: 100+ active users within 6 months of launch
- **Content Creation**: 50+ community-shared layouts within 3 months
- **SteelSeries Response**: Positive engagement or collaboration from SteelSeries

- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for cloud services, crash-free operation

## Open Questions

1. **Hardware Variations**: Are there different Zboard models that require different handling?
2. **Keyset Detection**: How does the Zboard communicate keyset changes to the host?
3. **SteelSeries Cooperation**: Will SteelSeries provide any technical documentation or support?
4. **Community Platform**: Should we build our own platform or integrate with existing services?
5. **Monetization**: How can we sustain development without compromising open-source principles?
6. **Legal Considerations**: What are the implications of reverse-engineering the USB protocol?
7. **Performance Requirements**: What level of input latency is acceptable for competitive gaming?
8. **Cloud Services**: Which cloud provider should we use for synchronization and community features?

## Next Steps

1. **Hardware Analysis**: Obtain and analyze a Zboard to understand USB protocol
2. **Driver Development**: Create basic HID driver for Windows 11 compatibility
3. **Prototype Mapping**: Build minimal mapping software to validate approach
4. **Community Outreach**: Engage with existing Zboard owners for testing and feedback
5. **SteelSeries Contact**: Reach out to SteelSeries for potential collaboration
